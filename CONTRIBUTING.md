# Contributing to the 3D Artist's Handbook

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines and helpful information for contributing to the 3D Artist's Handbook, which is
hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sidney-eliot/3d-artists-handbook). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use
your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

## What Should I Know Before I Get Started?

### Set-up for Contributing

1. You will need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/download). To check the current version and see if it's
   properly installed, use `node - v` & `npm - v` in your terminal of choice. _(Minimum required node version is v20
   and the minimum npm version is v9.3.1. If this is outdated for whatever reason, look at
   [quartz](https://quartz.jzhao.xyz/).)_

2. A version control software, I recommend [GitHub Desktop](https://desktop.github.com/download/)

2. Then, clone this repository inside of GitHub Desktop (_File > Clone repository_).

3. Switch the branch to the one containing the development content

4. Inside the repository folder using any terminal, execute the following commands:

   ```shell
   npm i
   npx quartz build --serve
   ```

5. Now, open a new browser window with the address: [https://localhost:8080](https://localhost:8080)  
   Note: If the above commands worked properly, you should see a prompt with this address as a result.

6. Before writing anything, please try to familiarize yourself with the [styleguides](#styleguides) below.

7. Before creating a pull request, it's recommended that you test it locally in your browser to see if your changes
   have been properly implemented.

### How Can I Contribute?

There are quite a bit of ways to contribute, here are a few examples:

- General proofreading and grammar.
- Improving on topics you are very knowledgeable in.
- Making or answering Issues.
- Making pull requests.
- Suggesting ideas or asking / answering questions in the repo's
  [Discussions](https://github.com/sidney-eliot/3d-artists-handbook/discussions).

The owner of this repo, Sidney, can also be contacted on Discord with the username `epicrex`.

### Work in Progress Sections

Work in progress pages are in the "/content/work_in_progress" folder and are hidden from the website, meaning they can contain rough drafts. Inside this folder, you can create your own folder like "YourName-wip". You can, of course, also keep your work in progress local or in your fork, but some like to share their work in progress pages with others so that others might take over and continue fine-tuning them.

Some pages, however, will contain a work in progress section at the bottom of the page with the header "ðŸš§ Work in
Progress ðŸš§". The stuff here is in a state which is readable and mostly factually correct, but just not integrated in
the page yet.

_It's very possible that in the future no more work in progress stuff will be allowed on the live handbook pages, and
instead all go into the work_in_progress folder, but for now, it will be this way._

## Styleguides

Keeping keywords and key terms consistent is important. There are two key reasons. Firstly, inconsistencies can lead to confusion. For example, ZBrush has something called a "Tool" emphasis on the capital T. Seeing this immediately shows the reader that the ZBush Tool is being talked about and not the English word "tool". The second reason is searchability of terms when using the Quartz built in search bar or you browsers `Ctrl` + `F` page search.

|          **Language**          | Use American English and not British English.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |            color, not colour             |
| **How to Address the Readers** | It has not been decided yet, if the reader is to be addressed with "you" or if one rather uses "one". Currently, most of the handbook uses "one". (Trying not to address the reader as much as possible is also an option.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                |                You or One                |
|       **Writing Style**        | Be concise and informative with what you write, trying to keep sentences only as long as they have to bey to convey the point that is being made. Treat the writing style more like a scientific research paper and less like some article. <br><br>Your north star should be to not waste the readers time, while at the same time not skimping out on detailed information.<br><br>There are many ways of doing this and often restructuring a sentence can make it a lot shorter while still keeping the important information. It can also be good top get to the point relatively quickly and the in subsections like admonitions blocks go into more detail.<br><br>3D is quite a complex subject and the oversight can often be lost, so keeping things intuitively structured is also important. |                                          |
|     **Showing Menu Paths**     | Use arrow to show the flow of navigation through menus. Make sure to keep a space between the arrows and words. Lastly make the entire path Italic (Italics are done with `_`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |            _Settings > Path_             |
|      **Showing Hotkeys**       | Surround hotkey keys strokes with a code block and separate each key with a + (Code blocks are done with backticks ` ).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                   |               `Ctrl` + `F`               |
|       **Units Denoter**        | The unit value and the denoter should be together without a spacing. In addition, the denoter should be lowercase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                        |    16px, 16bit, 16cm, 16m, 16km, 16kg    |
|        **Unit System**         | Use the metric system (no inches or feet for example).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |                                          |
|          **Headings**          | The biggest heading a page should have is H2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |                ## Heading                |
|       **Capitalization**       | Besides using basic English grammar for capitalization, there are some other things worth mentioning. Headers in pages should follow the [Chicago capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) guideline. If unsure, this [Capitalize My Title](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/) website can help format headers. Always capitalize software and tool names. Lastly, for the headers of admonitions / callout blocks, use normal sentence capitalization.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                                          |
|           **Links**            | Links to articles or YouTube videos should if possible include the name or some information, so that if the link is broken because the website or video is taken down, the reader can maybe still find it through some searching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |        [Descriptive Link Name]()         |
|           **Images**           | Never ever add images via links. Always download the image and add it to the _.../content/images_ folder. This is because it is quite likely that in a couple of years that image does not exist anymore at the source (e.g., the recent Imgur collapse).<br><br>Also, try keeping the image at reasonable file sizes (like under 500kb) and if possible in the JPG image format, to not affect page load times.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           |                                          |
|      **File Extensions**       | When writing out a file name which includes a file extension, write the extension lowercase. However, when talking about a file extension in general, remove the dot and capitalize all letters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                          |     .png, .blend, .zpr / PNG, BLEND, ZPR     |
|  **Abbreviations & Acronyms**  | Try not to use abbreviations, except for if they are very commonly used. Like the term UDIM which stands for U DIMension but is only ever used in it's abbreviated form.<br><br>Using common abbreviations like: etc. (Et Cetera), i.e. (in other words), e.g. (for example), c.a. (circa / about) is ok, but writing it out is just as valid.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |        UDIM, etc., i.e., e.g., c.a.         |
|        **Contraction**         | Use contractions whenever possible as they make will mostly make sentences sound more fluent and pretty (e.g. has not becomes hasn't).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  | doesn't, don't, hasn't, he'll, it's, ... |
|          **Slashes**           | When using slashes always leave a space before and after the slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                       |                  1 / 2                   |

|        SubDiv        | Most 3D software uses the Subdivision Surface Algorithm and nearly all of them use different names to refer to it.

### Markdown

Nearly all Markdown syntax and most of the Obsidian Markdown syntax is supported (HTML works as well). Here's a quick
refresher.

#### Format

**BOLD** `**BOLD**`, _Italic_ `_Italic_`, `Inline code` with back ticks `````, code blocks with triple back ticks `\`\`\``
above and below text.

####  Headers

```
# H1 <<< Reserved for page title. Don't use it in markdown

## H2 <<< Will be visible in table of contents
### H3 <<< Will be visible in table of contents
#### H4 <<< Won't be visible in table of contents
```

#### Images

```
![[image-name.jpg]]
```

#### Admonition / Callout blocks

```
>[!note] Title of note
>
>Note content
```

#### Internal Links

When linking to internal pages **always** give them a name as not doing so can lead to issues.

```diff
- [[Page Name]] <<< Don't do this

+ [[Page Name|Name of Link to Page]]
+ [[Page Name#Header Name|Name of Link to Page Header]]
```

#### External Links

Descriptive URL names are important as one doesn't know if the URL might become unavailable over time.

```
[Descriptive URL Name](https://www.google.com)
```

#### Some useful HTML

```
Line Break:
<br>
```

#### YouTube Video Embedding

Under a YouTube video, click _Share > Embed > Copy_. Always make sure to check "Enable privacy-enhanced mode" and if
desired check start "Start at ..." to skip to the vital point in the video.

For example:

```
<iframe width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube-nocookie.com/embed/dQw4w9WgXcQ?si=rZWhyUfBwWCAb52p&amp;start=8" title="YouTube video player" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; clipboard-write; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture; web-share" referrerpolicy="strict-origin-when-cross-origin" allowfullscreen></iframe>
```

Sadly, HTML iframes are a thing of the past as most websites nowadays block themselves from being framed, YouTube,
however, does not.

#### Tables

```
Center cligned table content:

|Name 1|Name 2|Name 3|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Value 1|Value 2|Value 3|

Left and right aligned table content:

|Name 1|Name 2|
|:-|-:|
|Left aligned value|Right aligned value|
```

#### Segment Line

Sometimes helpful to create splits that make information for digestible, try not to over use it.
