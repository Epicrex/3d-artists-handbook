# Contributing to the 3D Artist's Handbook

First off, thanks for taking the time to contribute!

The following is a set of guidelines and helpful information for contributing to the 3D Artist's Handbook, which is hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/sidney-eliot/3d-artists-handbook). These are mostly guidelines, not rules. Use your best judgment, and feel free to propose changes to this document in a pull request.

### Test Locally in a Browser Before you Push

The handbook website can easily be run locally on your device, using the first method described in [How to Read the Handbook Offline](https://github.com/sidney-eliot/3d-artists-handbook/tree/main?tab=readme-ov-file#how-to-read-the-handbook-offline). Before every it's recommended that you test it locally in your browser to see if your changes have been properly implemented.

## Styleguides

### Handbook Pages Styleguide

Keeping keywords and key terms consistent is important. There are two key reasons. Firstly, inconsistencies can lead to confusion. For example, ZBrush has something called a "Tool" emphasis on the capital T. Seeing this immediately shows the reader that the ZBush Tool is being talked about and not the English word "tool". The second reason is searchability of terms when using the Quartz built in search bar or you browsers `Ctrl` + `F` page search.

|          **Language**          | Use American English and not British English.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |         color, not colour          |
| **How to Address the Readers** | It has not been decided yet, if the reader is to be addressed with "you" or if one rather uses "one". At the moment most of the handbook uses "one". (Trying to not address the reader as much as possible is also an option.)                                                                                                                                                                                                                                              |             You or One             |
|     **Showing Menu Paths**     | Use arrow to show the flow of navigation through menus. Make sure to keep a space between the arrows and words. Lastly make the entire path Italic (Italics are done with `_`).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                             |         _Settings > Path_          |
|      **Showing Hotkeys**       | Surround hotkey keys strokes with a code block and separate each key with a + (Code blocks are done with backticks ` ).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |            `Ctrl` + `F`            |
|       **Units Denoter**        | The unit value and the denoter should be together without a spacing. In addition the denoter should be lowercase.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                           | 16px, 16bit, 16cm, 16m, 16km, 16kg |
|        **Unit System**         | Use the metric system (no inches or feet for example).                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                      |                                    |
|          **Headings**          | The biggest heading a page should have is H2.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |             ## Heading             |
|       **Capitalization**       | Besides using basic English grammar for capitalization, there are some other things worth mentioning. Headers in pages should follow the [Chicago capitalization](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Title_case) guideline. If unsure, this [Capitalize My Title](https://capitalizemytitle.com/style/Chicago/) can help format headers. Always capitalize software and tool names. Lastly, for the headers of admonitions / callout blocks, use normal sentence capitalization. |                                    |
|           **Links**            | Links to articles or YouTube videos should if possible include the name or some information, so that if the link is broken because the website or video is taken down, the reader is maybe still able to find it through some searching.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |     [Descriptive Link Name]()      |
|           **Images**           | Never ever add images via links. Always download the image and add it to the _.../content/images_ folder. This is because it is quite likely that in a couple of years that image does not exist anymore at the source (e.g. the recent Imgur collapse).<br><br>Also, try keeping the image at reasonable file sizes (like under 500kb) and if possible in the JPG image format.                                                                                            |                                    |
|      **File Extensions**       | When writing out a file name which includes a file extension, write the extension lowercase. However, when talking about a file extension in general, remove the dot and capitalize all letters.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                            |  .png .blend .zpr / PNG BLEND ZPR  |
|  **Abbreviations & Acronims**  | Try not to use abbreviations, except for if they are very commonly used. Like the term UDIM which stands for U DIMension but is only ever used in it's abbreviated form.<br><br>Using common abbreviations like: etc. (Et Cetera), i.e. (in other words), e.g. (for example), c.a. (circa / about) is ok, but writing it out is just as valid.                                                                                                                              |     UDIM, etc. i.e. e.g. c.a.      |
|          **Slashes**           | When using slashes always leave a space before and after the slash.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |               1 / 2                |
|            **Bold**            | No standards yet. Use sparingly to highlight key terms maybe.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |                                    |

|        SubDiv        | Most 3D software uses the Subdivision Surface Algorithm and nearly all of them use different names to refer to it. If one wants to not abbreviate it in a specific context for whatever reason, then one should call it: **Subdivision Surface** or **Subdivision Surface Algorithm** | Subdivision Surface, Subdivision Surface Algorithm, Subdivision Surface Modifier, SDiv, SubD |
