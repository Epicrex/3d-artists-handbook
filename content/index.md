## Hi
I'm **Sidney** _(Epicrex)_, a 3D character artist, and this knowledge pool is for me, you, and everyone else.

> [!info]- More about this handbook
>
> I'm a self-taught artist and I know just how difficult it can be, having to piece together all the snippets one gets from all kinds of sources. So I made this handbook to cover the entire workflow, as well as other things like composition, character design theory, anatomy, and more. I'm not saying that this is the end-all-be-all, but it can definitely be your main support line that you compliment with a bit of your own research.
> 
> My goal with this handbook isn't to cover entry level stuff, the methods and workflows I go over are for a big part industry standard and will yield great results. A perfect example of that would be the [[baking| baking]] page, in which I show how even amazing studios like Riot Games don't always have the best approaches to difficult problems.

This is probably best suited for intermediate and advanced 3D artists. If you're a 2D artist, then you might find something interesting [[#All Relevant Things from This Handbook for 2D Artists|here]]. My 3D workflow mostly consists of following software: [Blender](https://www.blender.org/features/), [ZBrush](https://pixologic.com/), [Marmoset Toolbag](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/), [Substance Painter](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html), [Photoshop](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and [Unreal Engine](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features). So this handbook will cover workflows in said software, but many of the concepts are universal and can be applied to other software as well.

If you don't understand a term, give the [[glossary|glossary]] a visit.

For more information about all the features of this handbook, have a quick read [here](https://github.com/Epicrex/3d-artists-handbook#info-about-this-handbook)

Feel free to point out things that might not be the best practice or plain incorrect, and I will fix those spots - [Discussion Area](https://github.com/Epicrex/3DArtistsHandbook/discussions/1).
