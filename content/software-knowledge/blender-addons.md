## Overview
I use almost all of these addons. Addons with a ðŸ”¥ are addons I love and think are essential. Addons with a ðŸ§± are addons that are shipped with Blender.

Many of these addons are free and others come with a hefty price. If you are willing to spend some money, then these are the only ones you really need:

- [Hard Ops / Boxcutter Ultimate Bundle](https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/D7aM/hard-ops-boxcutter-ultimate-bundle) - Which includes both Hard Ops and Boxcutter, essential for any 3D artist ($40)
- [UVPackmaster](https://uvpackmaster.com/) - Only if you do a lot with UVs ($44)
- [MESHmachine](https://machin3.gumroad.com/l/MESHmachine) - And if you feel like spending a bit more, I would recommend picking up MESHmachine ($40)

- `GoZ/GoB` ðŸ”¥ (Fluent workflow tool between ZBrush and Blender)
- `Extra Image List` (Bigger texture preview)
- `ARMORED-Theme Candy` (Makes customizing UI easy and fast)

## Hard Surface Modeling
- `Hard Ops` ðŸ”¥ (Hard Surface Modeling tools suite, a must-have for every modeler) [[Documentation](https://hardops-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)]
- `BoxCutter` ðŸ”¥ (Boolean operations) [[Documentation](https://boxcutter-manual.readthedocs.io/en/latest/)]

### Kushiro Kushiro's Tools
Kushiro's [channel](https://www.youtube.com/@kushirokushiro2306/videos) showcasing these addons.
- `Select Sim` ðŸ”¥ (A MASSIVE time saver tool, makes selecting fun)
- `Grid Modeler` (Block out/ Speed modeling)
- `Cut Corner`
- `Safe Ngon` (Boolean cleanup)
- `Quad Swords` (Dicing tool)
- `Attach Align` (Great snapping tool)

### Other
- `Cablerator` ðŸ”¥ (Cable maker)
- `Geo Cables` (Another cable addon, great in combination with Cablerator)
- `Bool Tool` ðŸ§± (Primitive version of BoxCutter) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/object/bool_tools.html)]
- `Loop Tools` ðŸ”¥ðŸ§± (Tool suite, things like Relax Mesh or Make Circle) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/mesh/looptools.html)]
- [`ARMORED-Toolkit`](https://github.com/ArmoredColony/ARMORED-Toolkit) ðŸ”¥ (All kinds of little scripts accessible through the search menu (F3))
- `Edge Flow` (Mesh manipulation)
- `Bygen` (Organic/ Procedural modeling)
- `Smart Fill` (Smart F fills, I don't use it anymore because of making F not instant anymore)
- `Smart Select`
- `Cell Fracture` ðŸ§± (Destroy objects) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/object/cell_fracture.html)]

## Sculpting
I don't use Blender sculpting addons anymore because I sculpt in ZBrush.

- `Sculpt/Paint Wheel` ðŸ”¥ (Easy access to sculpting tools)
- `Sculpt Layers` (Import ZBrush SubDiv levels)
- `Brush Manager`

## Rigging
For rigging in Blender, you need one of these 2 addons. They are even helpful when you create your entire rig by yourself (which I don't recommend with your first couple of rigs).

- `Rigify` ðŸ”¥ðŸ§± (My preferred tool and more commonly used) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/rigging/rigify/index.html)]
- `Auto Rig Pro`

## Animation

## Texturing
- `Bpainter`
- `DECALmachine` (Add hardsurface detail as textures)

## Asset, Material, HDRI
I don't use any of these anymore because I've switched to Substance Painter, Mari and 3D Coat for texturing. Blender's node system used for texturing is very inflexible and a pain to work with, when the projects goal is to be real-time/ Game-Ready or rendered in any other software.


- `Kit Ops Pro` (Kit Bash modeling/ Adding detail to your Hard Surface models)
- `Blenderkit` (Material library)
- `EEVEE-Materials` (Material library)

## VFX
- `Mesh Trails` (Made by [dillongoo](https://www.youtube.com/c/dillongoo/videos) and the best stylized VFX system for blender)

## UV
- `UV Packmaster` ðŸ”¥
- `UV Quads` ðŸ”¥
- `Dream UV`
- `TexTools`

## Node
- `Node Wrangler` ðŸ”¥ðŸ§± (Node managing tool) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/node/node_wrangler.html)]
- `Node Preview` (Shows the texture result of every node, extremely helpful for understanding complex node networks)

## Generation/ Procedural
- `A.N.T Landscape` (Landscape generator)

## Clothing
- `Simply Cloth Pro`
- `Simply Wrap Pro`

## Retopology
- `Quad Remesher` (Similar to ZBrush's ZRemesher, made by the maker of ZRemesher)
- `Retopo Flow` (Retopology, performance is quite lacking (not worth the price by a long shot))

## Other
- `3D Print Toolbox` ðŸ”¥ðŸ§± (Find and clean up bad geo) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/mesh/3d_print_toolbox.html)]
- `Copy Attributes Menu` ðŸ”¥ðŸ§± (Copy any attribute from one object to another) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/interface/copy_attributes.html)]
- `3D Viewport Pie Menus` ðŸ§±[[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/interface/viewport_pies.html)]
- `Conform Object` (Make objects perfectly hug curved surfaces)
- `Send2Unreal`
- `Hair Tool` (Probably obsolete with Blender's 3.4 update, which overhauls the hair workflow)
