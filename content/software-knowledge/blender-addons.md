## Overview
These are the addons I recommend using, most of which I use on a somewhat frequent basis. Addons marked with a lable, are addons I love and think are essential. "Built-in" addons are addons that are shipped with Blender.

Many of these addons are free and others come with a hefty price. If you're willing to spend some money, then these are the only ones you really need:

- [Hard Ops / Boxcutter Ultimate Bundle](https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/D7aM/hard-ops-boxcutter-ultimate-bundle) - Which includes both Hard Ops and Boxcutter; Essential for any 3D artist ($40)
- [UVPackmaster](https://uvpackmaster.com/) - Only if you do a lot with UVs ($44)
- [MESHmachine](https://machin3.gumroad.com/l/MESHmachine) - If you feel like spending a bit more, I would recommend picking up MESHmachine as well ($40)

## Rigging
For rigging in Blender, you need one of these 2 addons. They are even helpful when you create your entire rig by yourself (which I don't recommend with your first couple of rigs).

- **`Rigify`** _(My preferred tool and more commonly used)_ - [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/rigging/rigify/index.html)] - (Built-in)

## Texturing
_I don't do texturing in Blender._

- **Bpainter** - _removed by creator_

## Asset, Material, HDRI
I don't use any of these anymore because I've switched to Substance Painter, Mari and 3D Coat for texturing. Blender's node system used for texturing is very inflexible and a pain to work with, when the projects goal is to be real-time/ Game-Ready or rendered in any other software.

- [**Blenderkit**](https://www.blenderkit.com/get-blenderkit/) _(Material and asset library)_ - (free and paid)

## VFX
