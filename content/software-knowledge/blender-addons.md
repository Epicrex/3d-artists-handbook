## Overview
These are all the ad

I use almost all of these addons. Addons marked with a **`lable`**, are addons I love and think are essential. Built-in addons are addons that are shipped with Blender.

Many of these addons are free and others come with a hefty price. If you're willing to spend some money, then these are the only ones you really need:

- [Hard Ops / Boxcutter Ultimate Bundle](https://www.artstation.com/marketplace/p/D7aM/hard-ops-boxcutter-ultimate-bundle) - Which includes both Hard Ops and Boxcutter, essential for any 3D artist ($40)
- [UVPackmaster](https://uvpackmaster.com/) - Only if you do a lot with UVs ($44)
- [MESHmachine](https://machin3.gumroad.com/l/MESHmachine) - And if you feel like spending a bit more, I would recommend picking up MESHmachine ($40)

## Sculpting
I don't use Blender sculpting addons anymore because I sculpt in ZBrush.

- `Sculpt/Paint Wheel` (Easy access to sculpting tools)
- Sculpt Layers (Import ZBrush SubDiv levels)
- Brush Manager

## Rigging
For rigging in Blender, you need one of these 2 addons. They are even helpful when you create your entire rig by yourself (which I don't recommend with your first couple of rigs).

- `Rigify` ðŸ§± (My preferred tool and more commonly used) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/rigging/rigify/index.html)]
- Auto Rig Pro

## Animation

## Texturing
- Bpainter
- DECALmachine (Add hardsurface detail as textures)

## Asset, Material, HDRI
I don't use any of these anymore because I've switched to Substance Painter, Mari and 3D Coat for texturing. Blender's node system used for texturing is very inflexible and a pain to work with, when the projects goal is to be real-time/ Game-Ready or rendered in any other software.


- Kit Ops Pro (Kit Bash modeling/ Adding detail to your Hard Surface models)
- Blenderkit (Material library)
- EEVEE-Materials (Material library)

## VFX
- Mesh Trails (Made by [dillongoo](https://www.youtube.com/c/dillongoo/videos) and the best stylized VFX system for blender)

## UV
- `UV Packmaster` 
- `UV Quads` 
- Dream UV
- TexTools

## Node
- `Node Wrangler` ðŸ§± (Node managing tool) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/node/node_wrangler.html)]
- Node Preview (Shows the texture result of every node, extremely helpful for understanding complex node networks)

## Generation/ Procedural
- A.N.T Landscape (Landscape generator)

## Clothing
- Simply Cloth Pro
- Simply Wrap Pro

## Retopology
- Quad Remesher (Similar to ZBrush's ZRemesher, made by the maker of ZRemesher)
- Retopo Flow (Retopology, performance is quite lacking (not worth the price by a long shot))

## Other
- `3D Print Toolbox` ðŸ§± (Find and clean up bad geo) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/mesh/3d_print_toolbox.html)]
- `Copy Attributes Menu` ðŸ§± (Copy any attribute from one object to another) [[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/interface/copy_attributes.html)]
- 3D Viewport Pie Menus ðŸ§±[[Documentation](https://docs.blender.org/manual/en/latest/addons/interface/viewport_pies.html)]
- Conform Object (Make objects perfectly hug curved surfaces)
- Send2Unreal
- Hair Tool (Probably obsolete with Blender's 3.4 update, which overhauls the hair workflow)
