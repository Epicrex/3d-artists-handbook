>[!tip] Exporting tips
>
>- Make sure image is a JPG
>- Make sure video is a MP4 / MOV / GIF
(GIF being quite big but providing a loop functionality, however many sites also allow for MP4's to loop)
>- Wipe metadata
>- Use export instead of save as 
>- Export as sRGB not as `Embeded Color Profile`

>[!example] Great showcase examples (playlist, links)
