## Boxcutter
### Theory
- All options are under N>BoxCutter and the gear in the header
- Turn off Sort modifiers to not bevel new bool cuts, this is mostly desired(this can also be achieved by keeping this on and correcting the sort order)
- Some bool modes are in x cycle the others are in D-Helper
- Don't use magnet with Ngon but it's own built in angle lock (ctrl for magnet off)
- While placing bevel one can access the D helper menu after locking the bevel
- Bool snapping to object, view or origin can be adjusted in D-Helper
- Magnet is very important sometimes better without grid
- When using lasercut depth cap, the exact bool solver should be on

#### Bool Modes
- Slice: Extract shape
- Intersect: Only keep intersection area
- Inset: Shell like effect
- Join: Add shape on object
- Make: Add shape as new object
- Knife: Directly cuts edges into mesh (Watch out when going over bool mods)
- Extract: Select piece of geo for bool cut and then place the extracted shape
