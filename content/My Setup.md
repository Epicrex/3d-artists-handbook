- Reference Board: [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/), [MultiViewer](https://github.com/rgrams/multiviewer) (minimalistic alternative)
- Reference Manager (through tags): [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/) (far better than Adobe Bridge in every way), [Adobe Bridge](https://www.adobe.com/products/bridge.html). I highly recommend managing your reference art with tags, allot of issues arise with folders
