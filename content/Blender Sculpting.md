>Sculpting is better in ZBrush and ZBrush is the industry standard, which means that for most jobs you'll need to know how to use it. If you however don't have ZBrush, then here's a quick section about Blender sculpting.


## Blender to ZBrush Equivalent

|ZBrush|Blender
|:-:|:-:
|DynaMesh|Remesh
|ZRemesher|Default Blender doesn't have this.<br>The [Quad Remesher](https://exoside.com/quadremesher/) addon adds a similar functioning algorithm to Blender.
|Sculptris Pro|Dyntopo

## Blender Sculpting Workflow
Do the blockout with remesher, then either hand retopo, use a clean remesh addon or skip it for now. Then to add detail use the multires modifier. Try to stay away from Dyntopo the same as you would avoid Sculptris Pro in ZBrush, it develops bad habits.

More in other sections about workflow, it doesn't differ that much to that of ZBrush.

## Settings

>[!example] Focal Length
>
>Toggle: N > View > Focal Length
>
>A focal length of 35 or 50 is normal, something like 80 or 100 can however be to see more
details.
>
>Smaller focal length makes you see more of the model but less detail and 
higher focal length makes you see less of the model but more detail.
>
>ZBrush's default focal length is 50.

>[!example] MatCaps
> 
>- Chose a clay like MatCap that makes it easy to see things like crevices on the sculpt
>- Occasionally switch to a reflective MatCap to see if surfaces are smooth  

>[!example] Other Settings
>- Under Viewport Overlays, enable: Annotations, Statistics
>- Switch to annotation surface placement mode 
>- Turn on X mirror

>[!example] Brushes Settings
>- Front Faces only
>- Size Pressure = Off
>- Unified Radius = Off
>- Strength Pressure = On
>- Unified Strength = Off
>- Scrape > Tool Settings > Falloff = Constant
