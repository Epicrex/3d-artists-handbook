Why ProCreate texturing isn't used and what the devs can do

It's so sad to see how basically no one uses ProCreate 3D texturing after it being out for over 2 years and how they completely floundered this great opportunity.

The problem is that it's more targeted at hand painted texturing as realistic texturing requires a more robust software like Substance Painter (which is fine and would take far too much work to develop), but Procreate 3D is also unusable for hand painted texturing as they are unwilling to simply add in a flat shading mode (base color only). Doing hand painted work with HDRIs constantly on, is just not good in any way, and it's why one sees almost no stylized artists adopt this software into their workflows.

I would love to able do hand painted work on the go, when I don't have access to 3D Coat or Substance Painter. So let's hope for the best.
