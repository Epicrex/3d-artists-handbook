title: "Keyword Syntax of Handbook"
enableToc: false
---

To keep keywords consistent, I'll define them here. For example, a mistake that might happen is that one calls the ZBrush SubTool, "sub tool" instead of "SubTool". 

Some examples why this is important:

- Inconsistencies like this can lead to confusion. For example, ZBrush has something called a "Tool" emphasis on the capital T, seeing this immediately show the reader that the ZBush Tool is being talked about and not the English word "tool".

- It also makes it harder to search for terms in the handbook with the search bar or Ctrl+F.

|          SubDiv           | There are many names for the Subdivision Surface Algorithm which is used in every 3D modeling software, I'll call it SubDiv no matter how the software I'm currently talking about calls is. Occasionally I'll also use the full name. |

It's also good for the above mentoined reason to not abbreviate terms, a list of terms that are often abreviated are:

Acronims are fine.
