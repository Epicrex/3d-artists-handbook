To keep keywords consistent I'll define them here. For example a mistake that might happen is that one call the ZBrush SubTool, "sub tool" instead of "SubTool". 

Some examples why this is important:

- Inconsistencies like this can lead to confusion. For example, ZBrush has something called a "Tool" emphasis on the capital T, seeing this immediately show the reader that the ZBush Tool is being talked about and not the English word "tool".

- It also makes it harder to search through the wiki with Ctrl+F.

|Keyword|What it refers to|
|:-:|:-:
|SubTool|Every model in ZBrush has so called "SubTools"
|Tool|The entire model in ZBrush is called "Tool" (and has SubTools inside of it)
|SubDiv|There are many names for the Subdivision Surface Algorithm which is used in every 3D modeling software, I'll call it SubDiv no matter how the software calls is. Occasionally I'll also sue the full name
|polypaint|
|Topology|Don't use Topo??? 
|Settings > Path|Use arrow to show navigation through menus, make sure tho keep one space distance between the arrows
|Real-time|
|Hyper-Realistic|
|capitalize software names|
|MatCap|
|16 bit|Keep the number and bit separate
