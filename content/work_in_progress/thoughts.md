Edge control methods:
ZBrush makes some methods quite a lot more aluring, for example the zremesher, but that can cause massive increase in polies when subdividing. Compared to using more common method like placing edge loop for control. Becaue with that only the areas that need the detail get denser. I'm noticing that simple object with like 40k polygons quickly go to 4mil just because I added one small detail, and the entire mesh needes that extra density for that one detail. DynaMesh / sculptris pro one would think would be the soklution, but one shoudl stay away from terrible tool like those in the final stages of the model (anythjing that isnt blockout)
