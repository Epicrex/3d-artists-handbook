1.1.0

## Content Overhauls

- **Completely overhauled** the [rigging](add url) page and is for the most part complete. There are just some parts that still need to be finished, mainly the game-rig section
- **Added** a Substance Painter specific page which is still being worked on (unlisted for now)
- Added a skin texturing page which is still being worked on (unlisted for now)
- **Removed** emojis form page titles for a couple of reasons. One being that there were often no fitting ones for some pages resulting in a non-uniform experience, it was also messing up google indexing, and all in all it looks cleaner and more professional now. I might add them back in if I feel like it's worse without them, or I get feedback that people prefer them
- **Removed** the Unity hotkey page. As I don't think I'll ever be using Unity again myself nor be recommending it to others after that recent stunt they pulled. And Unreal is anyway the only engine that actually innovates with cutting edge features and improves the user experience over time

## URL Path Changes

- `/process` ➡️ `/mesh`

## Fixes

A lot of small fixes across many of the pages.

## Some Specific Things I'm Planning on Adding
- I'm thinking of slowly but surely adding banners to the top of every page with fitting images to give the pages more character and memorability. Think of it as a more mature replacement for the emojis that are now gone. I'm still looking for ways of improving the explorer views overview, by changing pages names or by other means.
- Removing the explorer cut off so more of the explorer can be seen at ance
