1.1.0

## Content Overhauls

- **Completely overhauled** the [rigging](add url) page and is for the most part complete. There are just some parts that still need to be finished, mainly the game-rig section
- **Added** a Substance Painter specific page which is still being worked on (unlisted for now)
- Added a skin texturing page which is still being worked on (unlisted for now)
- **Removed** emojis form page titles for a couple of reasons. One being that there were often no fitting ones for some pages resulting in a non-uniform experience, it was also messing up google indexing, and all in all it looks cleaner and more professional now. I might add them back in if I feel like it's worse without them, or I get feedback that people prefer them

## URL Path Changes

- `/process` ➡️ `/mesh`

## Fixes

A lot of small fixes across many of the pages.

## Some Specific Things I'm Planning on Adding
- I'm thinking of slowly but surely adding banners to the top of every page with fitting images to give the pages more character and memorability. Think of it as a more mature replacement for the emojis that are now gone. I'm still looking for ways of improving the explorer views overview, by changing pages names or by other means.
- Removing the explorer cut off so more of the explorer can be seen at ance

## Content Overhauls

- **Completely overhauled** the [Organic & Hard Surface - Sculpting & Modeling](https://sidney-eliot.github.io/3d-artists-handbook/presentation/modeling-and-sculpting) page and adding in Maya as well. For Maya specifically there are however still quite a lot of things that need to be added, as that software is incredibly feature rich

- **Added** [Drawing Tablet Issues](https://sidney-eliot.github.io/3d-artists-handbook/extra/drawing-tablet-issues) page (still a work in progress)
- **Added and Worked on** many unlisted pages which will hopefully soon be available
- **Removed** Post section, merging the Rendering and Compositing pages and adding them into Presentation 
- **Removed** Blender, ZBrush and Maya hotkey pages, as they are now a part of the [Organic & Hard Surface - Sculpting & Modeling](https://sidney-eliot.github.io/3d-artists-handbook/presentation/modeling-and-sculpting) page
- **Unlisted** a handful of pages for now, putting them into the work in progress section, as information on them was too basic and incomplete
- **Listed** [Skin Texturing](https://sidney-eliot.github.io/3d-artists-handbook/texturing/skin-texturing) page (still a work in progress)

## URL Path Changes

- `/mesh` ➡️ `/model-creation`
