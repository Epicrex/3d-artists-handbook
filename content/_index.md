# Hi
I'm **Sidney** (Epicrex), a Character Artist, and this knowledge pool is for me, you, and everyone else.

<summary>More about this handbook</summary>
~~~<br>
I'm a self-taught artist. I know just how difficult it can be, having to piece together all the snippets one gets from all kinds of sources. So I made this handbook to cover the entire workflow, as well as other things like composition, character design theory, anatomy, and more. Now I'm not saying that this is the end-all-be-all, but it can definitely be your main support line that you compliment with a bit of your own research.

This is probably best suited for intermediate and advanced 3D artist's. If you're a 2D artist look [here](#all-relevant-things-from-this-handbook-for-2d-artists). My 3D workflow mostly consists of following software: [`Blender`](https://www.blender.org/features/), [`ZBrush`](https://pixologic.com/), [`Marmoset`](https://marmoset.co/toolbag/), [`Substance Painter`](https://www.adobe.com/products/substance3d-painter.html), [`Photoshop`](https://www.adobe.com/products/photoshop.html) and [`Unreal`](https://www.unrealengine.com/en-US/features). So this handbook will cover workflows in said software, but many of the concepts can be applied to other software as well.

If you don't understand a term give the [[notes/Technical-Terms|glossary]] a visit.
