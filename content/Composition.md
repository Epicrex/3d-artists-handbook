## Focal Elements/ Emphasis
Focal Elements/ Emphasis dictates the rough order at which the eye looks at the different elements of the artwork. This doesn't just apply to static renders but composition can also be achieved in games and even outside of cutscenes. 

Great composition is achieved through:

### Color/ Saturation/ Contrast
Bolder colors for more important things and duller/ muted color for unimportant things. If the entire piece is very dark then lighter colors will draw attention and when it is very light darker colors will draw attention

### Placement of Key Elements
#### (Fibonacci) Golden Ratio/ Golden Mean
Having important points at the ratio of 1 to one edge and 1.68 to the opposite edge

#### Rule of Thirds
Rule of thirds isn't just used to place important points, but also to determine other things like:
- Surfaces where light hits vs shadows
- How much skin of the character should be revealed
- Ratio between shiny and matte materials
- Ratio of one color vs another color

1/3 stands out more than the 2/3.

#### Triangle/ Pyramid
Good for characters.

>![[Pasted image 20230604160753.png|400]]

A reason why the triangle is so good, is because it's a sturdy shape:

![[Pasted image 20230604160811.png|220]]


#### Flipped Triangle
A more dynamic version of the triangle. The triangle can also be tilted which can make it a bit more interesting.

#### Symmetry
Good to signal power, of a building for example. Symmetry line can be anywhere.

#### Full Frame

Full frame allows the viewer to focus on what is important and to se more detail. It is almost only used for characters and creatures. A great thing about full frame composition is that it can be achieved with basically every finished painting by cutting away sides and doing some small tweaks if, though preparing for a full frame instead of it being afterthought is still better.

### Negative Space
Positive space is a subject or point of interest and negative space is the surrounding area. More negative space gives the artwork space to breath while less negative space makes it more claustrophobic. Both can be good or bad depending on what kind of mood the artwork should convey.

### Energy Lines
Found in the pose of the character, can however also appear in the environment as rivers and roads for example.

![[Pasted image 20230604161249.png|450]]


### Guiding Lines

An object that guides the eye to a position, when correctly placed they can make the eye travel around the image the way the artist wants them to. An all time favourite is open umbrellas, because they so nicely guide the eye back into the artwork with their arch and can be held at any angle.

### Framing
- Vignettes
- Big windows
- Openings to the sky among dense buildings
- Dense trees at the left and right leading to a point in the middle

## Balance
Some elements in an image create weight and need to be balanced by other elements.

Elements that create weight:
- Colors/ Saturation/ Contrasts 
- Size
- Faces/ Figures

![[Pasted image 20230604162002.png|550]]

A way to find unbalanced points, is to turn up the contrast and blur. 

As we can see in the example below the presence of only one big light on the left makes the image very unbalanced:

![[Pasted image 20230604162027.png|400]]
![[Pasted image 20230604162039.png|400]]

Another example of how to properly balance an image:

![[Pasted image 20230604162125.png|500]]


## Positioning and Movement Direction
Moving to the left/ right, forward/ backward and so on, can portray different things in an image/ animation. Things like emotion, intent, power. (This can also apply to the direction in which the character is facing).

>- [Left or Right? Why a Character's Lateral Movement On-Screen Matters in Film](https://nofilmschool.com/2016/02/left-or-right-why-characters-lateral-movement-screen-matters-film)

#### Left/ Right
- **Moving from left to `RIGHT`:** Progression Of Time, Progress, Normality, To The Action _(Example: Soldiers running into battle to the right)_
- **Moving from right to `LEFT`:** Moving Back In Time, Regression, Abnormality, Back To Safety _(Example: Soldiers carrying wounded to the left)_

- **`Right` side of the screen:** Good, Positive
- **`Left` side of the screen:** Bad, Negative
#### Forward/ Backward
- **Moving `Forward`/ `Towards` the Camera`:** Power, Domination/ Dominance, Aggression
- **Moving `Backward`/ `Away` from the Camera:** Weakness

#### Top/ Bottom
- **Moving `Up`/ being at the `Top`/ being `looked up` at:** Dominance, Power 
- **Moving `Down`/ being at the `Bottom`/ `looking down` on:** Weak

#### Why Is This/ Examples
- Most languages read from left to right
- Books begin at the left and end at the right
- Evolution images show evolution starting at the left
- In platformers one starts on the left and ends on the right
- On graphs time increases as one moves to the right


## Tilt Shift Camera
Used to get straight lines in renders/ photographs and for panoramas. It's mainly used for architecture. It can also be done in compositing but that's a worst case scenario. To do this the camera should optimally be at an 90Â° angle, then change the shift amount on the desired axis. (In Blender this is in the camera tab)
