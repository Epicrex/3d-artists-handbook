_Sculpting is better in ZBrush and ZBrush is the industry standard (which means that for most jobs you'll have to use it). If you however don't have ZBrush, then here's a quick section about Blender sculpting._


# General
Blender to ZBrush equivalent
|ZBrush|Blender
|:-:|:-:
|DynaMesh|Remesh
|ZRemesher|Default Blender doesn't have this.<br>The [Quad Remesher](https://exoside.com/quadremesher/) addon adds a similar functioning algorithm to Blender.
|Sculptris Pro|Dyntopo

# Blender Sculpting Workflow
Do the blockout with remesher, then either hand retopo, use a clean remesh addon or skip it for now. Then to add detail use the multires modifier
- Try to stay away from Dyntopo, it develops bad habits

More in other sections about workflow, it doesn't differ that much to that of ZBrush.

# Settings
## Focal Length
(N > View > Focal Length) 

A focal length of 35 or 50 is normal, something like 80 or 100 could however be better if you want to be able to see more detail. 
```
Smaller focal length makes you see more of the model but less detail and 
higher focal length makes you see less of the model but more detail
```
ZBrush has a focal length of 50.

## Mat Cap
Chose a clay like matcap that makes it easy to see things like crevices in the model


## Other Settings
- For Annotations turn on Placement: Surface (Under Overlays turn on Statistics, Annotations)
