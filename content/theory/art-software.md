## Software Used in Studios

This chart gives a nice feel of what software is used, but be aware, that one doesn't need to be proficient in all the software a studio uses, to be hired there, as studios mainly hire based on skill as an artist and less so what software one is good at, one can always learn new software on a fly. Riot Games for example mainly uses 3D Coat for texturing, but there are artists at Riot, that use Substance Painter for hand painted texturing instead because that's what they're more familiar with. Studios also often vary the software based on the project at hand.

I won't mention ZBrush and Photoshop, as every single studio, no matter if game or film uses them.

Game Studios:
