## The Power of Simplicity

- Character Readability
- Empty surfaces make other surfaces with the actual key character defining detail stick out much more
- This also makes it possible to only have one texture for the entire character, which won't be possible if there are little details like small screws
- Little details are lost when farther away, the most important thing is big shapes and silhouette
