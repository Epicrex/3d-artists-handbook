- Reference Board: [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/), [MultiViewer](https://github.com/rgrams/multiviewer) (minimalistic alternative)
- Reference Manager (through tags): [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/) (far better than Adobe Bridge in every way), [Adobe Bridge](https://www.adobe.com/products/bridge.html). I highly recommend managing your reference art with tags, a lot of issues arise with folders

# My Setup for Sculpting / Texturing
For sculpting/ texturing, I use a keyboard in my left hand and my drawing tablet with my right hand. Having the 3D software open on the drawing tablet and reference on my main monitor and my mouse close by for when I have to do something on the monitor.
