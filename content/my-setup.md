## Utility Software
_Full list of art software [[art-software|here]]._

- Reference board: [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) and [VizRef](https://vizref.com/) for my tablet
- Reference manager: [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/) (Far better than Adobe Bridge in every way. I highly recommend managing reference art with tag based methods, a lot of issues arise with regular folders). 
- Screenshots: [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html), [GreenShot](https://getgreenshot.org/), `Win + Shift + S`, `Print key`
- Color Picker (from ref): [Windows Power Toys Color Picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker), [JCPicker](https://annystudio.com/software/colorpicker/). Art software often has a built-in color picker
- Color Palette Picker: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list), [Adobe Colors](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)

## Project Folder Structure
Always keep your project files organized. And use the same folder structure among your different projects.

>[!info] Some notes related to this structure
>
>Don't have the textures in the folder of your texturing software and rather have them in their own "Textures" folder. This is because one will likely edit the textures in multiple software like the texturing software as well as Photoshop, and often also use them for the final portfolio showcase or select them in a game engine. The "Low" folder is used for the retopologized model. One will have to export often into here for baking in Marmoset or if some changes to the model need to be re-imported into Substance Painter. A "Rigged Character", "Final Character" or whatever one wants to call it is also a good folder to have, if one is working with a game engine like Unreal.
