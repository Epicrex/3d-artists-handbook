## Utility Software

- Reference Board: [PureRef](https://www.pureref.com/) and [VizRef](https://vizref.com/) for my tablet
- Reference Manager (through tags): [Eagle](https://en.eagle.cool/) (far better than Adobe Bridge in every way), [Adobe Bridge](https://www.adobe.com/products/bridge.html). I highly recommend managing reference art with tags, a lot of issues arise with folders
- Screenshots: [LightShot](https://app.prntscr.com/en/index.html), [GreenShot](https://getgreenshot.org/), `Win + Shift + S`, `Print key`
- Color Picker (from ref): [Windows Power Toys Color Picker](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/powertoys/color-picker), [JCPicker](https://annystudio.com/software/colorpicker/). Art software often has a built-in color picker
- Color Palette Picker: [Coolors](https://coolors.co/), [Lospec](https://lospec.com/palette-list), [Adobe Colors](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel)
- EXR Image Reader: [DJV](https://darbyjohnston.github.io/DJV/)
- Preview all kinds of Image Extensions in File Explorer: SageThumbs (supports: .PSD / .TGA / .TIFF / .BMP / +defaults +more)
- Nightlight for my eyes: [F.Lux](https://justgetflux.com/)

## Project Folder Structure
Always keep your project files organized. And use the same folder structure among your different projects.

## My Setup for Sculpting & Texturing
For sculpting and texturing, I use a keyboard in my left hand and my drawing tablet with my right hand. Having the 3D software open on the drawing tablet and reference on my main monitor and my mouse close by for when I have to do something on the monitor.

## My Setup for Modeling
