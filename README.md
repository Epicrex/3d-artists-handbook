# Info About this Handbook

The 3D Artist's Handbook lives on [GitHub Pages](https://epicrex.github.io/3d-artists-handbook) and uses [Quartz](https://github.com/jackyzha0/quartz) and [node.JS](https://nodejs.org/en) in the backend.

### Handbook's Features
- **Fully Available Offline** 📶❌ - You can download the entire handbook for offline reding, just follow [these](#how-to-read-the-handbook-offline) simple steps
- **Read Time & Last Edit Date** ⏳📅- At the top of every page the average read time can be found as well as the date, when the page was last edited
- **Universal Search** 🌍🔍 - On the top left or top of every page, is a search field which can be used to search for headers or words all across the handbook 
- **Dark and Light Theme** 🌑☀️ - Beside the search bar of every page, is a sun/ moon icon, which are used to switch between the light and dark mode
- **Backlinks** 🔗 - On the left side or bottom of every page, is a backlink section in which you can view all other pages that link to the current page you're on
- **Interactive Graph** 🗺️ - At the bottom of every page, is a spider web of connections, this visualized how the pages link to each other (One can zoom in and out, pan the view, click the dots to navigate to the pages and click the little icon at the top right of the box to enlarge the box)
- **Quickly Return to Home Page** 🏠 - On the right or top of every page, is the title "🦑 3D Artist's Handbook". Clicking this will send you back to the home page
- **Embedded YouTube Videos** ▶️ - All videos found across the handbook are embedded YouTube videos. This gives the videos nice thumbnails and allows for them to be played directly within the handbook. If it makes sense, I have also set the videos to start at a specific time.
- **Instant Page Load Times** ⏱️ - There are no load times when clicking on links to other internal pages
- **Collapsible Sections** - Collapsible sections are found all over the handbook. They can be expanded with the `ᐯ` (arrow down) icon

# How to Read the Handbook Offline

You will need [Obsidian](https://obsidian.md/), which is a completely free note-taking software/ app available on Windows, Mac, Linux, Android, iOS and iPadOS.

**1.** Download the zip (and unzip) or clone the repository from the [v4 branch](https://github.com/Epicrex/3d-artists-handbook/tree/v4) (Click `<> Code` then click `Download ZIP`)
**2.** Open Obsidian and click `Open folder as vault`. Then navigate to the "3d-artist-handbook" folder you just downloaded and select the "content" folder inside of it. This will open the "content" folder in Obsidian and all the pages will be there for you to read.
**3.** (optional) If you want to do this in a more clean way, then create a folder called "Offline_3D-Artists-Handbook". Then open the "3d-artist-handbook" you just downloaded from GitHub, and copy paste the files inside the "content" folder to the "Offline_3D-Artists-Handbook".


**_Don't forget to give this GitHub repo a ✨ so you can easily get back to it._**
