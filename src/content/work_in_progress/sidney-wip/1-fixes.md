- remove the emojis

## Words to fix
- move resources from technical side of character design to the resources section
- Add booru sites to reference art sites and chnage order
- Process -> Model Creation, Texture to Texture creation, or just call it model, for better URI path
- Remove title emoji
- baking and text prep -> add a dash point with "and more"


The reason why [GoZ / GoB](https://github.com/JoseConseco/GoB/releases) is so good, is because it allows for the seamless use of all Blender's modeling and sculpting tools, as well as all of ZBrush's modeling and sculpting tools. Without the tedious manual exporting and importing. ->
