## Color Models
There are three color models commonly used by digital artists:
- [[color#RGB Color Model|RGB]]
- [[color#HSV & HSL Color Model|HSV & HSL]]
- [[color#Hex Color Model|HEX]]

Note that all these color models are in the RGB color space.

### RGB Color Model
RGB stands for Red, Blue, Green. An example of an RGB value is: 16,139,216. Every number group represents one color channel, 139 being the blue channel. Every color channel can range from 0-255. The amount of RGB colors are capped at 16777216.

**When to use**
Use is for quick color picking, colors that won't be final. Using RGB color model should be avoided, because it's very hard to select harmonious colors

### HSV & HSL Color Model
HSV stands for Hue, Saturation, Value whereas HSL stands for Hue, Saturation, Lightness. The difference being that a color with maximum tint (lightness) is white with HSL and the actual color in HSV.

HSL Example:

![[Pasted image 20230604142624.png]]

**When to use**
For 2D art and hand painted textures, this is pretty much always the best choice, because of being able to easily select different tints/shades of a color. But it's also good for any other color picking. The choice between HSV vs. HSL is a thing of preference, though HSV is probably the more popular one.

### Hex Color Model
A hex color is like RGB. The syntax is `#RRGGBB`, so green would be `#00FF00`. 00 means none of that channel and FF means 255 of that channel (0-9, A-F). It's also possible to store alpha in hex with the following syntax `#RRGGBBAA`, so green with alpha would be `#00FF0012`. The "A" can only range from 0-100.

**When to use**
HEX is almost only used for copying a color per values from A to B

|Keyword|What is it|What does it affect|Notes|
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
|Tint|Mixture of a color with WHITE|Lightens the color & increases the color's brightness|
|Shade|Mixture of a color with BLACK|Darkens the color & decreases the color's brightness
|Tone|Mixture of a color with GRAY|
|-|-|-
|Hue|Pure Colors(Primary Colors, Secondary Colors, ...). Ranges from 0Â° to 359Â° on the color wheel||Changing the Tint, Shade or Tone of a color doesn't change the hue
|Saturation|
|Value|Tint(lightness) and Shade(darkness) of a color|
|Chroma / Chromatic Intensity|A color where a hue predominates, blue, green, while white gray and black are achromatic because no hue predominates.

## Color Synergy
Colors which, when combined or mixed, cancel each other out or boost a one of the colors.
One of the things it's used for is to make things stand out.

### Official Synergy Types
A great place to create these synergies and understand how they work is [Adobe's color picker](https://color.adobe.com/create/color-wheel).

#### Complementary
- Dark Purple - Yellow, Lime Green - Light Purple
#### Split complementary colors

#### Analogous colors

#### Triadic colors

#### Tetradic or double complementary colors

#### Monotone chromatic
- Uses a single hue and all its tints, tones and shades
- Risk of monotony

#### Monotone achromatic
- Only neutral colors ranging from black to white
- Is monotone

|        Cyan        |     0,255,255     | `#00FFFF` |
|      Magenta       |     255,0,255     | `#FF00FF` |

## ðŸš§Work in ProgressðŸš§

#### Hue
- Changing the Tint, Shade or Tone of a color changes the Chroma / Colorfulness

#### Tint
- Changing the tint also changes the Saturation

#### Shade
- Changes the Saturation

#### Tone
- Or produced by both Tinting and Shading (Because white + black is gray)


#### terms to cover
colorfulness, saturation, purity, intensity, luminance

### Saturation
Saturation is changed by tint, shade and tone. Saturation is the purity / intensity / brilliance of a color. The higher the saturation of a color, the more vivid and intense it is. The lower a color's saturation, the closer it's to pure gray on the grayscale. Also chroma

### Brilliance & Brightness
Brilliance judged relative to the maximum brightness possible, whereas brightness is relative to the brightness of a similarly illuminated white object.
